== Course Info

**Welcome to CS110**. An introduction to the nature, subject matter and branches
of computer science as an academic discipline, and the nature, development,
coding, testing, documenting and analysis of the efficiency and limitations of
algorithms. 

This semester, we will be exploring the creative aspects of coding as a context
for learning the above concepts. You will exercise your creativity by designing
programs in a language called, Processing. Processing is built upon the
programming language Java. Processing was created by artists, designers, and
computer scientists to explore ideas of creative coding using computer
algorithms. The blurb below, from Shiffman's text is an excellent description of
what we will be doing this semester:

[quote, Daniel Shiffman, From: Learning Processing, page ix.]
____
This book tells a story. Itâ€™s a story of liberation, of taking the first steps
towards understanding the foundations of computing, writing your own code, and
creating your own media without the bonds of existing software tools. This
story is not reserved for computer scientists and engineers. This story is for
you.
____


This course is an introduction to computing: how we can describe and solve
problems using a computer. Students will learn how to write algorithms,
manipulate data, and design programs to make computers useful tools as well as
mediums of creativity. Contemporary, diverse examples of computing in a modern
context will be used, with particular focus on graphics and visual media. The
Processing/Java programming language will be used in lectures, class examples
and weekly programming projects, where students will learn and master
fundamental computer programming principals. 

_This course is appropriate for all students who want to learn how to write
computer programs and think like computer scientists_.

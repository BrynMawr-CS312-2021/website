**Welcome to CS312**. An introduction to computer graphics. Computer graphics
is a fundamental technology underlying many applications such as digital
photography, film, video games, simulation, training, product design,
architecture, and fabrication. 

In this class, we will study the fundamental algorithms and data structures 
used to generate images on a digital display. Students will learn multiple 
approaches for representing 3-dimensional objects and simulating lights and materials. 

Students will additionally gain experience programming with C++ and using git
for source control. Students will also practice deriving the mathematical
models that underlie common graphics algorithms. These skills will empower
students to create their original digital artworks as part of assignments and
the final project.

Computer graphics is a multi-disciplinary subject, combining knowledge about
hardware, design, physics, and linear algebra. Computer graphics can be a
daunting subject because it draws on diverse knowledge and skills. But it
also offers many opportunities and ways to succeed! You can focus on aesthetics, 
user experience, hardware performance, mathematics, or software algorithms. 
Not to mention how satisfying it is to see digitally bring your own ideas to life 
and be able to share them with others!

== Texts and software

**Texts**

Some lecture material will be based on information from the following textbooks:

Real-Time Rendering, Fourth Edition 4th Edition, 
by Tomas Akenine-MoÂ¨ller, Eric Haines, Naty Hoffman
(available as an e-book at the library)

Fundamentals of Computer Graphics 4th Edition, by Steve Marschner, Peter Shirley

**Software**

The Bryn Mawr labs have the following software setup. Students may use the
computers in Park 230 (Windows/Linux) and 231 (macOS). 

* **Github Account** Please go to link:https://github.com/[github.com] and register. You will be using github to submit assignments. 
* **Slack** Please go to link:https://slack.com/signin[slack.com]. Our workspace is BrynMawr-CS312-S21. You can ask questions and request one-on-one help over zoom using this course's slack channel. 
* **C++ development environment** Please follow the instructions at link:https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS312-2021/cplusplus-beginners[cplusplus-beginners] 
* **Graphics development environment** Please follow the instructions at link:https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS312-2021/getting-started[getting-started] 
* **Blender (Optional)** Please go to link:https://blender.org[blender.org]. Blender is an open-source 3D modeling tool and advanced renderer. We will occasionally use blender to inspect and edit models and materials.
* **Gimp (Optional)** Please go to link:https://gimp.org[gimp.org]. Gimp is an open-source image manipulation tol, similar to Photoshop. Photoshop is also fine to use if you are familiar with it. We will occasionally use this program to edit images and generate textures. 

== Grading Policies

All graded work will receive a grade, 4.0, 3.7, 3.3, 3.0, 2.7, 2.3, 2.0, 1.7,
1.3, 1.0, or 0.0. At the end of the semester, final grades will be calculated
as a weighted average of all grades according to the following weights:

|===
|30% | Final Project
|50% | Assignments
|20% | Math jams and math presentations

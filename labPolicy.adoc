=== Labs

Because class is remote this semester, labs will not be formal meeting times
as they normally would be.

Most weeks, labs will be additional office hour time. I expect that you will run into 
problems while working on your assignments. Please don't hesitate to come to me 
with these problems. That's what I'm here for. 

Some weeks, we will have *math jams* in lab, which will be timed problem sets which you 
will solve in teams. This is a low stakes way to learn the 3D mathematics you need 
for graphics programming and will hopefully be fun. The week following a math jam 
will be for you to present your answers to the jam problems the week before. 

At the end of the semester, we will use lab to share weekly progress on our projects.
